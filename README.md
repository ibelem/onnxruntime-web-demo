# WebNN Developer Preview

Run ONNX models in the browser with WebNN. The developer preview unlocks interactive ML on the web that benefits from reduced latency, enhanced privacy and security, and GPU acceleration from DirectML.

[WebNN Developer Preview website](https://microsoft.github.io/webnn-developer-preview/).

_NOTE: Currently, the supported platforms are Edge/Chromium (support for other platforms is coming soon)._

## Use Cases

The website provides four scenarios based on different ONNX pre-trained deep learning models.

### 1. Stable Diffusion 1.5

[Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/onnxruntime-web-temp/demo/tree/main/stable-diffusion-1.5) is a latent text-to-image diffusion model capable of generating photo-realistic images given any text input.

### 2. SD-Turbo

[SD-Turbo](https://huggingface.co/onnxruntime-web-temp/demo/tree/main/sd-turbo) is a fast generative text-to-image model that can synthesize photorealistic images from a text prompt in a single network evaluation. In the demo, you can generate an image in 2s on AI PC devices by leveraging WebNN API, a dedicated low-level API for neural network inference hardware acceleration.

### 3. Segment Anything

[Segment Anything](https://huggingface.co/onnxruntime-web-temp/demo/tree/main/segment-anything) is a new AI model from Meta AI that can "cut out" any object. In the demo, you can segment any object from your uploaded images.

### 4. Whisper Base

[Whisper Base](https://huggingface.co/onnxruntime-web-temp/demo/tree/main/whisper-base) is a pre-trained model for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation. In the demo, you can experience the speech to text feature by using on-device inference powered by WebNN API and DirectML, especially the NPU acceleration.

## Run WebNN Developer Preview

### Install Dependencies

```
cd webnn-developer-preview
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
npm install
```

> The private and public keys are used for local https connection, WebNN can only run in secured contexts. This step is optional if running with <http://localhost> since it's considered a secure context and will behave like https.

### Run the website

**WebNN installation guides**

WebNN requires a compatible browser to run, and Windows* 11 v21H2 (DML 1.6.0) or higher.

1. Download the latest [Microsoft Edge Canary](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/download/insider) browser
2. To enable WebNN, in your browser address bar, enter `chrome://flags`, and then press `Enter`. An Experiments page opens
3. In the Search flags box, enter `webnn`. Enables WebNN API appears
4. In the drop-down menu, select `Enabled`
5. Relaunch your browser

**Run the website in localhost**

```
npm run dev
```

This will start a dev server and run WebNN Developer Preview demos with the WebNN enabled browser on your localhost.
